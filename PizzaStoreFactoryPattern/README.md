Pizza Store

Factory pattern implemented: PizzaStore class delegating concrete implementation to it's subclasses: NYPizzaStore, ChicagoPizzaStore

Dependency inversion implemented: higher level components (PizzaStore...) and lover level components (NYCheesePizza...) depend only on higher level abstraction - Pizza class. Higher level components are not coupled to many concrete lower level components.
